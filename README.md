# Volatility Regime Detection & Strategy Backtest

## Objective
To analyze how volatility regimes influence return behavior and evaluate a simple regime-filtered strategy.

## Methodology
- 21-day rolling annualized volatility
- Median threshold classification
- Strategy active in low volatility regime
- Performance comparison using Sharpe Ratio and cumulative returns

## Results
The regime-filtered strategy demonstrated improved risk-adjusted returns compared to market baseline under selected periods.

## Future Improvements
- Transaction cost modeling
- Regime clustering using unsupervised learning
- Adaptive volatility thresholds
- Multi-factor regime classification
